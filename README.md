## Inspiration

This visual is a modified version of [Gramener Senate Similarity](https://gramener.com/playground/senate/similarity).

The ideology score is from [GovTrack](https://www.govtrack.us/about/analysis#ideology).

## Reproduction

If you would like to reproduce this visualization you can clone this repo. The bulk of the code will simply run in your browser, just open [index.html](index.html). I have saved the data and images in the repo so you will not need to do anything else. If you would like to use my method for retrieving the images you will need to use NodeJS and npm to install the `node-fetch` package and run [fetchImages.js](fetchImages.js).
